EarthBound/Undertale fights:
decide which attributes to include from which game

EarthBound:
- heavily based on chance
- cookie heals about 6HP, chances of hitting, status effects
- similar to pokemon
- turn based
- party members (Ness, Paula, Jeff, and Poo)
- speed is important to determine turn order (remember Ness is pretty slow)
- Battle backgrounds (and lots of colors)!

Undertale: 
- lots of motion
- attacks are dodged with heart
- different color souls do different things
- attacks are in form of objects that disappear and cause damage when collided with
- fighting is timing based (more accurate means more damage)
- turns where you attack and where you dodge
- not as based on chance as EarthBound 
- speed not important (player always takes action first)
- dark background with black/white sprites (with some colored attacks)

Both:
- options for what to do (be it Fight, Act, etc. or Bash, PSI, Goods, etc.)
- text during battles

Decisions:
- battle backgrounds
- PSI attacks (lifeup, fire, thunder) (can miss)
- items heal exact amounts of HP
- Bash uses Undertale timing meter
- simple sprites
